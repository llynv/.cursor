### Debug protocol
1. Reproduce with minimal input (link gist or inline).
2. Trace cause → effect; highlight faulty var/state.
3. Stepping plan by language:
   * **C#** – VS/Rider breakpoints, Memory window.
   * **TS/JS** – Chrome DevTools, ignore `node_modules`.
   * **C++** – gdb/lldb + `rr` replay.

### Productivity boosters
* Pre-commit hook: `npm test` or `dotnet test`.
* VS Code `tasks.json` & `launch.json` skeleton if missing.
* Suggest feature flag if fix spans > 3 files.
